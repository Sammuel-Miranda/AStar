# Roy-T.AStar | PathFinder

*Forked from version: 2.1.0*, of Roy-T.AStar

A fast 2D path finding library based on the A* algorithm originaly for `.NETStandard 1.0` and `.Net 4.5` and higher. This library has no external dependencies. The library is licensed under the MIT license, see the `LICENSE` file for more details.

I made changes to the base library to become compatible with .Net 2.0 and above. The code was very well done and free from dependencies, so it was easy to accert 1 time LINQ was used to a more direct loop. Also, made a few functions to import/export to JSon (no dependency needed) and made certain functions to be a overload instead of a complete code.
